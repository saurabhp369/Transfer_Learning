# Transfer_Learning
This notebook describes the steps to apply a deep learning technique commonly referred to as Transfer Learning.

Specically, Transfer Learning can be used for deep learning applications where either data or computational power are restricted.

In this notebook, we are using a Monkey dataset from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/slothkong/10-monkey-species/home with limited number of training samples and perform fine grain classification to identify the species of monkeys using Transfer Learning
